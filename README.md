# GitHub Followers App
# This is an application based on a iOS course by Sean Allen in his Take Home Project Course
# It teaches the fundamentals and tools one needs to become an Jr. iOS developer
# Utilizes programmable UI (No Storyboard)
# No 3rd party API's except for GitHub api
# Search screen feature and UICollectionView
This also has a custom UI for the alert that pops up when there has been no user entered.
Uses network calls for accessing follower data and information.
Uses UItabBarController to have searchVC and favorites VC as two different screens.
# Current work in progress
